# Name: phate_getLast3percent.py
#
# Programmer:  Carol Zhou
#
# Last Update: 21 December 2020
#
# Description: This code captures the remaining 3% of pVOG sequences
#    from the NR database, which could not be retrieved in the original
#    capture.  Recall that a subset (query on anything that looked like
#    phage) of NR was used locally to pull sequences. Pulling either
#    from a downloaded complete NR or via web query would have been
#    very slow. However, the query subset was missing about 3% of the
#    pVOG sequences. Hense, this code to retrieve the remaining 3%
#    using directy query from a local instance of the complete NR.
#    Should be fast enough to do just 3% locally.
#
# Usage:  python3 phate_getLast3percent.py  (IMPORTANT: READ BELOW)
#    NOTE:  First run phate_createPvogFastaFile.py. This will search the
#       NCBI phage subset database and tag the fasta headers with the
#       pVOG information. Then, take the output from that code, 
#       pVOGs_missing.lst, and use that as input to this (current) code.
#       The output will be a fasta file containing the missing fasta
#       sequences. Then, you need to add those sequences to the NR
#       phage fasta subset file, and RE-RUN phate_createPvogFastaFile.py
#       (or run separately and add when they are done).
#       Then, the output from that code (i.e., pVOGs.faa) should 
#       contain 100% of the pVOG sequences, pulled from NR.
#
# Programmers Notes:
#    NOTE:  As currently written, this code finds only the 1st ncbiID in
#       the nr database, then 'skips' through the rest. Need to fix that
#       (ie, figure out how the SeqIO is actually working.) Nevertheless,
#       querying the 1st ncbiID required 1/2 hour, which means that the
#       set of 5000 will require 3 months on a single mpath processor.
#       !!! I need to find a better way.
#    1) Filenames are coded as constants
#    2) Only need to run this code one time (until update)
#    3) This code only pulls the missing fasta sequences. The user must
#       than add these sequences to the NR subset and re-run the original
#       code, phate_createPvogFastaFile.py (see NOTE above).
